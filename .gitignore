# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
api_administration/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/api_administration/log/*
/api_administration/tmp/*
!/api_administration/log/.keep
!/api_administration/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/api_administration/tmp/pids/*
!/api_administration/tmp/pids/
!/api_administration/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/api_administration/storage/*
!/api_administration/storage/.keep
/api_administration/tmp/storage/*
!/api_administration/tmp/storage/
!/api_administration/tmp/storage/.keep

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/api_administration/config/master.key

## Specific to RubyMotion (use of CocoaPods):
#
# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:
# https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control

## Documentation cache and generated files:
/api_administration/.yardoc/
/api_administration/_yardoc/
/api_administration/doc/
/api_administration/rdoc/

## Environment normalization:
/api_administration/.bundle/
/api_administration/vendor/bundle
/api_administration/lib/bundler/man/

# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
/api_administration/.rvmrc
